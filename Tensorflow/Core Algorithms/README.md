[Linear Regression](https://github.com/GSelvakumar/ml/blob/main/Tensorflow/Core%20Algorithms/Core_Algorithms_linear_regression.ipynb) is one of the basic forms of machine learning and is used to predict numeric values.

[Classification](https://github.com/GSelvakumar/ml/blob/main/Tensorflow/Core%20Algorithms/Core_Algorithm_Classification.ipynb) is used to separate data points in classes of different labels. There are many models for classification here, DNNClassifier (Deep neural network) is used.

[Clustering](https://github.com/GSelvakumar/ml/blob/main/Tensorflow/Core%20Algorithms/Core_Algorithm_Clustering.ipynb) is used to cluster data. This technique involves the grouping of data points.
