**Tensorflow** basic concepts and ideas.

This [Core Algorithms](https://github.com/GSelvakumar/ml/tree/main/Tensorflow/Core%20Algorithms) has the basic ml algorithms like Linear Regression, classification, clustering and Hidden Markov models

[Neural Networks](https://github.com/GSelvakumar/ml/blob/main/Tensorflow/neural_networks.ipynb) is the layered representation of data. Here Fashion clothing dataset from tensorflow is used and had detailed view about various concepts like loss/cost function, backpropagation, gradient descent etc.
